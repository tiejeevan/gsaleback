                    ADMIN TESTING SYSTEM - USER GUIDE
================================================================================

OVERVIEW
--------
The admin testing system allows administrators to test all platform features
including admin actions, real-time notifications, and user interactions.

FEATURES
--------
1. Admin Actions Testing
   - User creation and authentication
   - Mute/unmute functionality
   - Suspend/unsuspend functionality
   - Soft delete and restore
   - Permission enforcement

2. Real-Time Features Testing
   - Socket connections
   - Post notifications
   - Comment notifications
   - Mention notifications
   - Like notifications
   - Follow notifications
   - Real-time comment updates

ACCESSING THE TEST DASHBOARD
-----------------------------
1. Login as an admin user
2. Navigate to Admin Dashboard
3. Click "🧪 Test Dashboard" button in the top right
4. Or go directly to: http://localhost:3000/admin/tests

RUNNING TESTS VIA WEB INTERFACE
--------------------------------
1. Go to Admin Test Dashboard
2. Configure test username and password (optional)
3. Click "Run Tests" on either test suite:
   - Admin Actions Test
   - Real-Time Features Test
4. View results in real-time
5. Check summary for passed/failed tests

RUNNING TESTS VIA COMMAND LINE
-------------------------------
1. Admin Actions Test:
   cd gsaleback
   node test-admin-actions.js

2. Real-Time Features Test:
   cd gsaleback
   node test-realtime-features.js

TEST RESULTS
------------
Each test will show:
- ✅ Green checkmark = Test passed
- ❌ Red X = Test failed
- Test name and description
- Detailed error messages for failures
- Summary with total passed/failed

TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
1. Tests failing to connect:
   - Ensure backend server is running on port 5001
   - Check that database is accessible
   - Verify admin credentials are correct

2. Socket tests failing:
   - Ensure Socket.IO is properly configured
   - Check that ports are not blocked
   - Verify real-time features are enabled

3. Permission tests failing:
   - Restart backend server after middleware changes
   - Check that admin user has proper role
   - Verify database user status fields

ADDING NEW TESTS
----------------
1. Backend Test Script:
   - Add test function to test-admin-actions.js or test-realtime-features.js
   - Use logTest() function to record results
   - Add to runTests() sequence

2. Frontend Dashboard:
   - Add test name to testSuites array in AdminTestDashboard.tsx
   - Test will automatically appear in UI

3. API Endpoint:
   - Tests run through /api/test/admin-actions or /api/test/realtime
   - Modify routes/test.js to add new endpoints

BEST PRACTICES
--------------
1. Run tests after any major changes
2. Test in development environment first
3. Review failed tests immediately
4. Keep test users separate from real users
5. Clean up test data periodically

AUTOMATED TESTING
-----------------
You can integrate these tests into CI/CD:
1. Add to package.json scripts:
   "test:admin": "node gsaleback/test-admin-actions.js"
   "test:realtime": "node gsaleback/test-realtime-features.js"

2. Run in CI pipeline:
   npm run test:admin
   npm run test:realtime

SECURITY NOTES
--------------
- Test endpoints should be protected in production
- Use environment variables for test credentials
- Limit test execution to admin users only
- Monitor test execution logs
